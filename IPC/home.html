        <p>
            Inter-process communication (IPC) and shared memory are important concepts in operating systems and
            parallel computing. They enable communication and data sharing between different processes or threads
            running on a computer system.

        <h2>Shared Memory:</h2>
        <p>
            Shared memory is a technique that allows multiple processes to access the same memory space. It provides a
            fast and efficient way for processes to communicate and share data. Shared memory can be implemented using
            various mechanisms such as semaphores and mutexes to synchronize access to the shared memory region.
